# Beardroid

The vision for this project is:

Create a slack interface for hooking in multiple callbacks, an abstraction to
make interacting with it easy

Create an interface for configuration data:
- Properties for slack users (JSON)
- Properties for channels (JSON)
- Ability to have indexed properties

Add other integrations like GitHub and CI

Add building blocks for "typical interactions", whatever those turn out to be
